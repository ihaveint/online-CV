- project: Wait Free Simulation of an inherently concurrent system
  role: A toy project to improve my knowledge of the
    Elixir programming language
  duration: 2020
  description:
    <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>
    Utilized some ideas inspired by blockchain technologies to reach
    a wait free algorithm that simuluates a wild ecosystem of animals.
    There are interactions between wild and domestic animals,
    where domestic ones can be eaten. Thereâ€™s also possibility for
    reproduction of animals, and also moving along different directions.
    All of the  mentioned events happen concurrently and in a wait free manner.
    </li></ul>
