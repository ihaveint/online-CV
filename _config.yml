  am interested in a few things :))
  At the time of writing this, I'm mostly interested in the study of
  distributed systems,
  how it can mitigate some of the problems with today's software development,
  and also how formal methods can be used to make systems
  (particularly distributed one's) safe and trustworthy.
  I also enjoy working on concurrent data structures and other tools
  that try to tackle the problems that arise in concurrent environments.</p>"
